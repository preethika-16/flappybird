# Flappy Bird
Flappy Bird - A 2D Game Development Project

Problem Statement:
In the world of game development, creating engaging and interactive experiences requires a deep understanding of event-driven programming, physics-based mechanics, and user interface design. The Flappy Bird game is a perfect example of this, offering a simple yet addictive gameplay experience. The goal of this project is to replicate the popular Flappy Bird game using Java, providing aspiring developers with a strong foundation in building 2D games.

Solution:
This project presents a fully-functional Flappy Bird clone built with Java and Java Swing. The game simulates realistic gravity, collision detection, and score tracking to deliver an immersive and engaging experience. Players control a bird that must navigate through a series of pipes, gaining points for each successful pass. The application uses object-oriented programming principles to manage game states, render graphics, and handle user inputs efficiently. The design ensures smooth frame rates, responsive controls, and an intuitive interface, offering an enjoyable and challenging gameplay experience.

Features

Physics-based Mechanics: The game incorporates realistic gravity to make the birdâ€™s movement natural and smooth. When the player presses the spacebar, the bird flaps its wings and moves upward, then gradually falls due to gravity.

Real-time Score Tracking: The score is updated in real-time as the player successfully navigates through pipes. A game-over screen displays the final score, encouraging players to improve their performance.

Smooth Animation and Obstacle Generation: The game dynamically generates obstacles at different intervals, ensuring variety in gameplay. The movement of the pipes and the bird is animated seamlessly to provide a fluid gaming experience.

Replay Functionality: After losing, players can restart the game instantly without needing to reload the application. This feature keeps the gameplay engaging and encourages multiple attempts.

Lightweight and Optimized Performance: The game runs efficiently on different systems without requiring high-end hardware, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

Tech Stack:
Java (Core Game Logic), Java Swing (GUI & Event Handling)

Target Audience:
Casual gamers who enjoy simple yet challenging games can have fun playing this. Students and educators who need an example project to learn about game development and programming concepts will find this helpful. Developers interested in building 2D games with Java can use this as a reference project.
